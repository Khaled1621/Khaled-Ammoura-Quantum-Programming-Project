    "First, we need to note that the expectation value of Pauli-X obsevable is determined by the state's alignment with the X-axis on the Bloch sphere, meaning Pauli-X measures the projection of the final state along the X-axis. Inituitively, someone would say that we should have the same expectation value in both circuits. For example, let's take a classical example, suppose I have a ball that I should move only in two routines, either up then right, or right then up. Classically, someone would say that immaterial of which routine we take the ball will end at the same place, which is correct, but in classical scenarios, not in quantum mechanics. Quantum rotations don't commute, meaning the order of the applied unitary operations matters in quantum mechanics.\n",

    "Both circuits produce the same ⟨𝑍⟩ values. This is because the gate combinations in both circuits generate states with the same symmetry along the Z-axis., i.e. absolute difference = 0. Circuit-1: 0.3536 and Circuit-2: 0.3536, there absoulue diffecence = 0, as expected."

    "\n",
    "No. The order in which RX and RY are applied significantly affects ⟨X⟩, but didn't affect that of ⟨𝑍⟩. Since, for ⟨X⟩ it results in different alignments with the X-axis, however for ⟨𝑍⟩ it results in a symmetric state indifferent of the order."

    "\n",
    "Someone would notice that the probability of the computation basis (i.e., |0> and |1>) is the same for the 4 circuits (2 for ⟨X⟩, 2 for ⟨𝑍⟩), because the probability of these gates depends on their projection on the Z-axis, and since there were no rotations along that axis (only on X-axis and Y-axis),the effect of these rotations do not directly affect the state's alignment with the Z-axis in a way that changes the probabilities in the computational basis. Therefore, their probabilities are expected to be the same, and that what we observed. Circuit 1-2-3-4: P(|0>) = 0.6768 and P(|1>) = 0.3232. "
